# Maticha

A C-like interpreted programming language under developement, created for the sole purpose of having a programming language that has an "unless" statement, which is an alias for "if not", just like in the English language.

```
unless x == 0 {
    print("x is not 0");
}
```
or, in a nicer way:
```
print("x is not 0") unless x == 0;
```

The language however does offer more than just an *unless* statement.


*A proper documentation is to come soon.*
